# Word Grabber
A command line program in Kotlin that puts an inputed word into a .txt file with a definition and part of speech.

The program uses the Oxford Dictionary API. **Please get your own API key and ID if you want to use this.**

## Things it'll do
1. Make a nice list of words with their part of speech and definition.
2. You can change what the output looks like in the .txt file

## Directions
1. Figure out how to use the program. I just use it in IntelliJ.
2. Start the program.
3. Type in a word.
4. Input a number for the definition you want to use.
5. Keep going if you want to.
6. There's currrently no actual way to quit it. I just quit it with the quit button in IntelliJ.
7. Get your .txt file, do what you want with it.

## Things it won't do/known issues
1. Built in quitting.
2. If a word can't be found, the program just crashes.
3. I'm pretty sure it's horrible on memory, so just don't do massive lists of words at once. I could be wrong on this though.
4. It's a little slow to make the list of definitions.

## Things I want it to do someday
1. Be able to quit on its own.
2. Make the .txt be a numbered list.
3. Be faster.
