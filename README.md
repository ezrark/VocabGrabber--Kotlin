# Word Grabber
A command line program in Kotlin that puts an inputed word into a .tex file with a definition and part of speech.

The program uses the Oxford Dictionary API. **Please get your own API key and ID if you want to use this.**

## Things it'll do
1. Make a nice list of words with their part of speech and definition.
2. You can change what the output looks like in the .tex file

## Directions
1. Figure out how to use the program. I just use it in IntelliJ.
2. Start the program.
3. Type in a word.
4. Input a number for the definition you want to use.
5. Keep going if you want to.
6. Quit by pressing "q" when it asks.
7. Get your .tex file, do what you want with it.

## Things it won't do/known issues
1. If a word can't be found, the program just crashes.
2. I'm pretty sure it's horrible on memory, so just don't do massive lists of words at once. I could be wrong on this though.
3. It's a little slow to make the list of definitions.

## Things I want it to do someday
1. Be faster.
2. Take the author's name to be put in the .tex file
3. Deal with words without definitions.
